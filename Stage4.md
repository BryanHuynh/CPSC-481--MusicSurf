### Heuristic Evaluation of MusicSurf Report
The heuristic evaluation of our application revealed minor bugs and understandability and consistency issues. However, there are no severe problems that were rated as a “5” on the scale. Most bugs indicate that some buttons (i.e. back button), search bars, and minor features (i.e. queuing of songs) are not implemented and do not respond when clicked. A few inconsistencies in functionality were brought to light as some paths through the app’s pages are fully developed while others are not. We plan to address these problems by fixing the bugs and implementing error messages where appropriate. Accessory features that are not fully implemented will be indicated as future directions. 
The explore page caused a lot of confusion, specifically the volume and track sliders, which are not clearly labeled, and some of the buttons. These problems are due to the large number of features available on the page, the novel layout,  and the lack of instructions or explanatory text. These same issues are also present in a smaller capacity on other pages, such as “my library” and “now playing”. For example, users were confused on how to skip to the end of a song, as this feature was not placed in an intuitive location for them. To address these problems, we will include user manuals, tool tips, and instructions for each page to help guide the user and ensure they are aware of and know how to use all the features. Additionally, we will reorganize the layout of the pages to make them more intuitive, minimalistic, and aesthetically pleasing. 
Additional suggestions related to aesthetic choices (i.e. colour scheme), dead-end screens (i.e. users can only use the back button to leave the page), button design, and headers and borders. Addressing these minor issues will help polish our app and make it look professional. We will try to tackle these in stage 5, along with the other edits we will make based on this heuristic evaluation.
