## MusicSurf

MusicSurf proposes using visualization in order to present a more natural experience when interacting with music. While most music apps on the market today present music in lists, MusicSurf looks to create a dynamic interface for interacting with music libraries by visualizing key elements of songs such as mood, speed and volume range that are important for users to select songs from their library and placing those songs such that it facilitates a browsing experience as opposed to a searching experience that current apps provide. MusicSurf also proposes a novel way of playing music. Current music apps often play music from playlists or albums which are designed to be listened to either in order or in random order. MusicSurf on the other hand presents music in network with songs connected to each other by heuristics such as mood, speed, genre and so forth allowing users to explore music as they would explore a forest on foot. The user can either provide MusicSurf with heuristics which determine the path that MusicSurf takes or they can manually choose the path the MusicSurf takes. 

MusicSurf is aimed at both casual listeners and music enthusiast alike as a day to day music app for choosing their music as theyâ€™re walking or a sit down experience to discover something new that fits their current mood.
