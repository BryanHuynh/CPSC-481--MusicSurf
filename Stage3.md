### User Research Methods, Justifications and Reflections

Our brainstorming session consisted of all members presenting their individual sketches to the group, and eliciting feedback. Everyone explained their sketches and then we created an affinity diagram on the wall using sticky notes. For each sketch, we posted what we liked, what we didn’t like and any other miscellaneous thoughts that came to mind. However, many of our ideas/sketches were fairly similar to each other. Next time, in the early ideation stages we should not share ideas too much so everybody brings forth a fresh perspective.

On that note, it took us longer than expected to come up with a solid prototype design. Everyone had an idea of what we wanted to accomplish and emphasized making a design wholly different from anything currently existing. It is difficult to break away from media player design conventions that have been ingrained in us our whole lives and design something truly novel. Another difficulty we encountered was that though many of our preliminary designs were unique and visually innovative, they were not user friendly. To an extent, we had to sacrifice our desire for true novelty in order to make a functional design.

Problems that may arise from our design stem from unfamiliarity with the elements that are utilized throughout the application. As it stands now, things such as tags, colors and what terms mean (i.e. “Discover new music”) would have to be learned by the user through trial and error and experimenting with our design. We will need to address that when creating our high fidelity prototype and ensure that the user definitively knows what effect their actions will have. On that note, we would also need to include clarifying text (i.e. “tempo” or “bpm”) in places where there are now symbols. Overall, our design has many features that are standard of media players and thus it should be easy for any previous music-listener to navigate. The issues come when our user is someone who has never before used a media player because our app has the standard layout of many other players with the addition of novel exploratory layers that are unique. One way to address this would be to include a tutorial explaining the application, although this risks alienating a user who is looking for a simple application for their purposes. It is not uncommon for someone to see how complex an application is and subsequently uninstall it.

### Task Descriptions

Micheal is a university student. He’s studying and wants to find music that will help him focus. He knows that he wants relaxed music, so he starts by looking through his music library for a chill song. He finds John Lennon’s Imagine, which is ideal, and sets the system to keep playing songs with a similar tempo. After 45 minutes, he finds the playlist has become too slow, but earlier songs were perfect. He looks at his music history and finds that a previous song was Billy Joel’s Piano Man. He then begins playing songs with similar themes and tempo to Piano Man. As he’s finishing studying, he finds himself listening to a new song he really enjoys and adds it to his library before closing the app.

Brittany is a 25 year old banker who wants to kick back and relax. She normally likes listening to pop music, but today wants something different, so she puts a random song on. She likes the beat, but finds the style too reggae. She wants a song with a similar feel, but closer to music she’s used to. She follows one of the branching paths generated by the system and listens to Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffet. She wants more songs by Jimmy Buffet so she gets the platform to play his collection randomly shuffled.

Sona has recently gotten into Japanese punk, but she cannot read Japanese, so it’s hard for her to find new songs in the genre. She likes Omega Rhythm by Uplift Spice and wants similar songs to add to her library. She flips through songs in the genre until she finds ヒステリックナイトガール feat. Such  by PSYQUI, which she enjoys. Sona wants to add it to her library, but fears it will get lost in her other Japanese songs, so she attaches a note to the song indicating it has a “catchy beat”. She then finds other songs with similar rhythms and categorizes them so they can all be found through their mutual notes of “catchy beat”. 

Ken has a song that’s stuck in his head that he can’t put a name to. He knows how the beat goes and it reminds him of Uptown Funk, so he searches for this song. He then traverses connecting paths with songs in the same style, but with slower tempos. He goes through 5 songs before This is America by Childish Gambino appears, which is really close to what he’s thinking of. He looks at other songs by this artist and finds Redbone, which is the song stuck in his head. He adds it to his library and pop playlist. 

Kate has just been through a bad breakup and she wants music that relates to her situation and mood. She looks through her library and starts listening to Bad Blood by Taylor Swift, however the other songs in this album and in her pop playlist are not breakup songs and do not convey the same tone. So Kate traverses the system for songs with lyrics about heartbreak and gets numerous suggestions. She filters them based on their mood, depending on if the lyrics are more angry or sad, listens to previews of ones that interest her, and adds the ones she likes to a “Breakup” playlist. 

Harry has an extremely large and diverse music, with self-made playlists that are poorly organized and frustrating to browse. He erases these playlists and visualizes his library on the platform without any self-imposed organizational categories. He then tells the system to organize his music by genre, language, and decade. He adds songs from each generated cluster into a different playlist with the filters specified in the titles. He deletes songs he no longer likes to declutter his collection as he moves from cluster to cluster creating fresh, updated playlists.

Sean is a wedding planner and wants to create the perfect playlist for his clients’ reception dance party. He wants upbeat, popular music guests can sing along to so he searches for songs that are considered “music to play at a wedding reception”, “fun”, and “pop”. He adds songs he recognizes and likes from the generated cluster to his playlist. Sean also knows that the bride and groom love The Beatles, so he filters the cluster for songs that are by this artist and adds them to the mix. Lastly, the wedding is taking place on a beach in Hawaii, so he adds “beachy” and “beach wedding” to the original search terms and picks out some songs that will tie in with the theme and location of the wedding while still matching the mood of the other music in the playlist.
