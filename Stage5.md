### Executive Summary


### Design Problem


### End-users and Stakeholders
End-users may include regular music listeners who love creating playlists, exploring new music and different kinds of genres. This application also helps users who look for specific kind of music by searching for songs using specific tags related to the kind of songs they are interested in as the app can create Smart Playlist or a Custom Playlist caterring to the user's needs.  

Some stakeholders may include music labels and the artists themselves as they work to create and spread their music to their respective fanbases where all these fans are also considered to be the end-users as well. 

### User Research and Findings
After conducting a series of interviews of frequent music listeners, we were able to understand people's music exploration preferences and thoughts on the platforms they used which turned out to be either Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube Music. 
Some secondary research was conducted to investigate important components of exisiting systems in order to understand the concept of these successful applications. By compiling the data from interviews and user research, a low fidelity prototype of MusicSurf was successfully created, followed by a high-fidelity prototype with greater improvements to the user interface and prototype functionalities such as moving back and forth from screens, searching music, logging in, music controls etc. 

### Design and Justification 


### Heuristic Evaluation and Findings
A heuristic evaluation conducted on this prototype by another team of designers resulted in a series of minor bugs and\technical difficulties which include the prototype's consistency, standards, aesthetic design, button functionalities and color schemes. However, there were some severe problems with the prototype that was addressed as confusions rose with the explore menu and some of the buttons which wasn't labelled correctly.

In order to address these problems, we have created a series of changes in the design that will ensure the user to minimize the bugs faced by users. 

### Design Changes

### Recommendations for Next Iteration
The goal for the next iteration would be to help users understand how the application can be used with better documentation and guidance, reducing the steps to complete certain tasks, re-organize and optimize the screens for efficiency and adjusting color schemes and layouts for a nicer design. 

### Conclusions
