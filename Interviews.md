### Findings
[Notes from Interviews](https://github.com/mwahba13/CPSC481/raw/master/Stage%202/HCI%20Interview%20questions%20(Responses).xlsx)

From our interviews, people listen to music during a variety of activities, but some stick out as being more frequent. Namely, when in transit. 100% of our interviewees reported that they listen to music when driving, riding the bus, walking or partaking in other forms of transportation. Other common activities include working out, studying and outliers are before going to bed.

Majority of respondents listen to their music on either Spotify or Youtube, with Apple music coming in next. Spotify and Youtube were highlighted due to it being easy to explore a large collection of music. Notably, YouTube was commended for its recommendation algorithm which creates playlists based on users’ previous listening history. It appears that the prime factors for choice in platform comes down to price, ease and selection.

When asked how they discover new music, respondents had similar answers. Majority either heard about a song from a friend or had it recommended based on a Spotify or Youtube playlist recommendation. When searching for new music, respondents reported that along with uniqueness, the expected mood of a song also contributes to whether that song is saved to their personal collection. Few respondents reported that they listen to random playlists generated for them and keep the songs they “like”.
